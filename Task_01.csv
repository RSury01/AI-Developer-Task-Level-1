"This story is about Anshul - CMO at OLA Electric. Anshul was clear that OLA Electric must become a differentiated and the most innovative & thriving e-mobility company in the Indian market. ""We want to drive e-mobility revolution in the country & encourage faster adoption of e-scooters thereby contributing toward the fight against climate change"", Anshul stated in a conference. Anshul's key theme was clean mobility for millions of Indians.But how could OLA achieve this milestone and that too with UBER's market presence and rapid growth in UBER electric and concept of sustainable safe mobility. He became so intrigued by the success of UBER's business model to the point where he was contemplating on conducting an independent study.One morning Anshul had to meet his marketing team for the presentation on the new marketing strategy for the OLA S1. The team consisted of Vibhor - Brand Marketing Lead and Nishant - Associate Director of Marketing. The primary focus of the campaign would be low cost, low maintenance and unseen innovative value additions to benefit the end user and split the competition.The branding would be advertised through Leoburnett Orchard & Indigo consulting an agencies that have held with OLA for a couple of years. With several different ideas and suggestions it was clear that today the use of virtual assistants is inevitable since the these platforms prove to save a great deal of cost and as markets continue to evolve with the prominence of Open AI, GPT. AR & VR. The team was looking forward to scaling the idea as the plans were put into place. The website and app received decent traction on the first couple of days. The viewership of content saw gradual rise. But even amist the hurls of past negative sentiment with regard to fire incidents, damages & wiring faults made users turn to Ather , TVS and other e-mobility companies. OLA was missing something in this new strategy.They had the right branding and marketing in place. But what they did not have was a story to sell. More importantly they failed to understand they changing user needs that let a downfall even further. The learning for Anshul and his team was that a business may deploy the latest technologies and best digital models. It may even invest a lot in marketing campaigns and ad agencies. But if the business does not build a story that is based on a understanding of various customer segments,needs and painpoints then it is likely to not succeed.The essence of branding is story telling and the essence is story telling is convincing my customer that his specific need will be satisfied through my story."
